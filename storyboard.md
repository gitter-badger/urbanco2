## Storyboard

### Urban Co2 Emissions
1.  Cities and the cumulative processes of urbanization are estimated to contribute approximately 30-40% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere.

### Sources and Sinks
2. The main sources of co2 in cities are fossil fuel combustion from transport, hvac, and biogenic sources. Urban vegetation can also act as a sink.

### Cities as a solution
3. cities have a great potential to reduce emissions and global impact - but monitoring methods are sparse. Quanitfying emissions is key to reduction.

### Sensing and Actuating
4. Mobile monitoring has a great potential for quantifying emissions at the city scale.

### New Methologies
5. We develop this new methodology using aerodynamic resistances to determine emissions and measure throughout the city.
